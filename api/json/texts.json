R. 23\n1ST SESSION\nAN ACT\nTo impose sanctions with respect to the International Crimi-\nnal Court engaged in any effort to investigate, arrest,\ndetain, or prosecute any protected person of the United\nStates and its allies.\n1 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-\n2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n2\n1\nSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n2 This Act may be cited as the \u2018\u2018Illegitimate Court\n3 Counteraction Act\u2019\u2019.\n4\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n5 Congress finds the following:\n6 (1) The United States and Israel are not par-\n7 ties to the Rome Statute or members of the Inter-\n8 national Criminal Court (ICC), and therefore the\n9 ICC has no legitimacy or jurisdiction over the\n10 United States or Israel.\n11 (2) On May 20, 2024, the Prosecutor of the\n12 International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, an-\n13 nounced arrest warrant applications for Israeli\n14 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister\n15 of Defense Yoav Gallant and should be condemned\n16 in the strongest possible terms.\n17 (3) On November 21, 2024, the ICC\u2019s Pre-Trial\n18 Chamber issued warrants for the arrest of\n19 Netanyahu and Gallant, which should be condemned\n20 in the strongest possible terms.\n21 (4) The bipartisan American Servicemembers\u2019\n22 Protection Act was enacted in 2002 to protect\n23 United States military personnel, United States offi-\n24 cials, and officials and military personnel of certain\n25 allied countries against criminal prosecution by an\n26 international criminal court to which the United\n\u2022HR 23 EH\n3\n1 States is not party, stating, \u2018\u2018In addition to exposing\n2 members of the Armed Forces of the United States\n3 to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the\n4 Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and\n5 other senior elected and appointed officials of the\n6 United States Government may be prosecuted by the\n7 International Criminal Court.\u2019\u2019.\n8 (5) The ICC\u2019s actions against Israel, including\n9 the preliminary examination and investigation of\n10 Israel and issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli\n11 officials, are illegitimate and baseless and create a\n12 damaging precedent that threatens the United\n13 States, Israel, and all United States partners who\n14 have not consented to the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction.\n15 (6) The United States must oppose any action\n16 by the ICC against the United States, Israel, or any\n17 other ally of the United States that has not con-\n18 sented to ICC jurisdiction or is not a state party to\n19 the Rome Statute of the ICC.\n20\nSEC. 3.
